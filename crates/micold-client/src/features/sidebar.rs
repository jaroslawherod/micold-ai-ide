//! The sidebar's rows and tag filters (feature 021, T016).
//!
//! A sidebar row is a *projection*: a worktree or the project root, joined with its sessions and
//! with the tags rendered beside its name. Nothing here holds the sidebar's own mutable state —
//! that lives in `State` until Tier 3 — so this module is the row vocabulary, the pure functions
//! over it, and the projections that build the rows, kept together per FR-001.
//!
//! The projections at the bottom arrived in T019, which had filed them under "worktree". They are
//! named for worktrees but typed for the sidebar — `worktree_tree` returns `WorktreeNode`,
//! `available_tag_filters` returns `TagFilter`, and `worktree_tree`'s doc comment opens "Build the
//! sidebar tree". Grouping by name rather than by feature is what FR-001 argues against, and
//! SC-010 is answered by where a feature's code sits, not by what it is called.
//!
//! They are `impl State` blocks because `State` is still monolithic in Tier 1. Methods resolve on
//! the type rather than the module, so relocating them changed no call site.
