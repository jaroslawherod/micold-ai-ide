## Decisions

| # | Phase | Question | Answer | By | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | spec | Is #434 a bug against a Closed spec, or new behaviour? | New behaviour, own spec. 027 FR-023b already names a missing CLI under Default AI CLI, but no closed spec requires a reason or an action. | agent-resolved | specs/027-sandboxed-daemon-runtime/spec.md#FR-023b; specs/029-pi-cli-provider/bugs/BUG-001.md#spec.md ("no requirement that a hidden CLI be explained") |
| D2 | spec | Feature number | 037. 036 is taken by `036-tooltip-follow-cursor-delay` in the `fix-issue-430` worktree. | agent-resolved | `ls <worktree>/specs/03[6-9]*` on 2026-10-01 |
| D3 | spec | Do the environment reasons apply under container placement? | Yes. Environment-include applies where sessions run under both placements, so "the image lacks it" is true only when the environment resolved in full. Refines 027 FR-023b. | agent-resolved | specs/029-pi-cli-provider/spec.md#FR-003b; Spec review round 1, F5 |
| D4 | spec | Is the reply an AI session gets for a missing CLI in scope? | Yes (FR-009a). It says "is not installed", the claim FR-002 forbids. | agent-resolved | crates/micold-daemon/src/mcp/tools.rs:470; Spec review round 1, F4 |
| D5 | clarify 1 | On a row with fewer than two available CLIs (no chevron), where is a CLI that is not offered explained? | Option B: not at the row. The chevron rule stays. The reason appears only in a row list that already opens (two or more available, another missing). A one-CLI row is unchanged; Settings (Story 1) and the start and restart messages (Story 2) serve that user. No closed spec is amended. Options A (always show the chevron), D (show it only when the environment was not applied) and C (drop Story 3) were declined. | decided by user | specs/026-multi-provider-sessions/spec.md#FR-006; specs/033-directory-aware-start-affordance/spec.md#Clarifications; issue #434 |
| D6 | clarify 2 | Does the list a row with fewer than two available CLIs opens for a missing default (033 FR-010) name the CLIs not offered? | No. FR-010 applies only with two or more available. The FR-008 message carries the reason there; with nothing available the FR-009 failure does. | agent-resolved | D5; specs/033-directory-aware-start-affordance/spec.md#FR-010; crates/micold-client/src/ui/sidebar.rs#start_press |
| D7 | clarify 2 | Which reason does a row give while it is drawn from the home answer (033 FR-005)? | The home answer's: offer and reason come from one answer (FR-012), and both switch when the row's own arrives. FR-011's silence is for no answer in use. | agent-resolved | specs/033-directory-aware-start-affordance/spec.md#FR-005; crates/micold-client/src/features/session.rs#AvailabilityAnswers::for_dir |
| D8 | clarify 2 | Do SC-003 and SC-004 count the row's CLI list? | Yes. FR-001 covers FR-006 to FR-010; both criteria now name it. | agent-resolved | specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#FR-001 |
| D9 | clarify 3 | Does a row's CLI list give the action as well as the reason? | Yes. FR-001 pairs each reason with its action and SC-003 already counts the list. FR-010, Story 3 scenario 1 and SC-007 now say "reason and action". | agent-resolved | specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#FR-001; specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#FR-003 |
| D10 | clarify 3 | Does a message already shown at an event (missing-default message, start failure, AI-session reply) change when a newer answer arrives? | No. It states the reason that held at its event. Only the Settings note and an open row list follow a newer answer. A start failure's reason comes from the environment that start resolved, the resolution the answer shares. Corrects the round-2 edge case that said the message "follows". | agent-resolved | crates/micold-client/src/features/session.rs#start_menu_toggled; specs/029-pi-cli-provider/spec.md#FR-003b; crates/micold-daemon/src/state.rs#ai_clis_available_in |
| D11 | clarify 3 | How does a reason stay true when it reports the home directory's attempt on a project row (D7)? | New FR-004a: a reason that reports an attempt (last four states) names the directory the attempt was for. The two settings states name none. | agent-resolved | specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#User Story 1 (scenario 3); specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#Edge Cases |
| D12 | clarify 4 | FR-004a makes the "last attempt succeeded" reason name a directory; FR-005 and Story 2 scenario 4 keep 027's container sentence unchanged. Which holds under container placement? | FR-005. The container sentence names the CLI and the image and no directory, in Settings and at a failed start. FR-004a covers the three failed-attempt states under both placements and the last state on the host only. Story 1 scenario 5 now names the home directory. | agent-resolved | specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#FR-005; specs/027-sandboxed-daemon-runtime/spec.md#FR-023b; crates/micold-daemon/src/state.rs#missing_cli_reason; crates/micold-client/src/features/settings.rs#missing_cli_notice |
| D13 | design | FR-009 said a start failure must not tell the user to install the CLI in the first five states, but FR-001's table gives "or install the CLI on the login PATH" as part of the action in the first two, and FR-012 requires every surface to give the same action. Which holds? | FR-001 and SC-003. FR-009 now says installing is never the only action in those states and is not named at all in the three failed-attempt states. Story 2 scenario 2 (a failed-attempt state) stays true. | agent-resolved | specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#FR-001; specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/spec.md#SC-003; specs/037-explain-hidden-cli/research.md#R7 |

## Declined review findings

| Milestone | Review | Finding | Why declined |
|---|---|---|---|

## Handover

Design unit 1 stopped at the context cap (151k) after writing the plan. Nothing is pushed and no
PR is open. `branch-start.sh 515` reported `REBASED 6`; do not run it again.

**Done** (one local commit on top of the six clarify commits):

- `speckit-plan` artifacts written: `plan.md`, `research.md` (R1–R9), `data-model.md`,
  `contracts/availability-answer.md`, `contracts/reason-wording.md`, `quickstart.md`.
  `.specify/extensions.yml` has no `before_plan` or `after_plan` hook.
- spec.md FR-009 corrected (D13).
- `checklists/requirements.md` has no unchecked item.

**Next steps**, in order:

1. Plan review round 1 by a fresh reviewer (plan rubric; `review-snapshot.sh` first, record the
   snapshot in *Review rounds*). It has not run yet. Things the author did not verify and the
   reviewer should: every path in plan.md's source tree exists or is marked new;
   `crates/micold-daemon/tests/mcp_create_session.rs` is the right home for U5; `docs/daemon.md`
   is where the protocol version is recorded; the paragraph API named for
   `menu_panel_size_with_note` (research R6) can measure wrapped text.
2. `speckit-tasks` (its `before_tasks` docguard hook and `after_tasks` hooks are optional; run
   `speckit-tdd-plan`, since `before_implement` makes `speckit-tdd-run` mandatory), then cut
   milestones and add them to the ledger. Intended cut:
   - **M1** (full, MVP): core `cli_reason`, the wire field and version 18, the service's
     `ResolvedEnv` and answer, the client's `env` and `asked_for`, the Settings notes (U1, U2),
     `settings.md` and `sandboxed-daemon.md`, `docs/daemon.md`, visual pass B1–B8 (B14). US1.
   - **M2** (full): the start failure (U4), the reply to an AI session (U5), the missing-default
     message (U3), `worktrees-and-sessions.md` and `agent-tools.md`, visual pass B9–B10. US2.
   - **M3** (full): `MenuOverlay::note`, `start_menu_note`, the showcase entry, the row-list
     paragraph of `worktrees-and-sessions.md`, visual pass B11–B13. US3.
   - **M4** (docs): Polish. Quickstart Part A record and cross-checks of the spec artifacts.
3. `speckit-analyze`, fix its findings, then the tasks and milestone review.
4. `mise run test-scripts`, push, open PR 2 with `Refs #434`, record its number here.

**Open findings**: none yet (no review has run).

## Open escalation

None.

## Token usage

## Follow-ups not done

- The issue text says nothing names a hidden CLI. Settings already does (027 FR-023b): "*<name>*
  isn't installed on this computer, which is where sessions run." The spec treats that sentence as
  the thing to correct.
