# Autopilot ledger — 039-session-attention-notifications

Kept by the `speckit-autopilot` skill. Records what this flow owns and how far it got. `resume`
finds this file by its **Worktree branch** line. Keep it true.

- **Input**: Implement GitHub issue #481: https://github.com/jaroslawherod/micold-ai-ide/issues/481 — Issue title: Notify when a session needs attention and track unread sessions. Issue body: ## Problem — The sidebar already shows each session's activity dot (working / awaiting input), but only while the user is looking at the window. With several agents running in parallel, a session that finished its turn or is waiting for a permission prompt goes unnoticed until the user happens to check it. There is also no way to tell which sessions have new output the user has not looked at yet. ## Proposal — When a session moves to **awaiting input** (turn ended, permission or idle prompt), show an OS desktop notification naming the project, worktree and session. Clicking it focuses the window and switches to that session. — Mark a session **unread** when it produces a turn the user has not viewed since it became active, and clear the mark when the user opens the session. — Show an unread count on the project in the switcher, so attention needed in a background project is visible. — Suppress the notification when the session is the one currently focused. — Settings: on/off for desktop notifications, and optionally per provider. ## Acceptance criteria — A session that reaches awaiting input while another session is focused (or the window is unfocused) raises exactly one desktop notification on Linux and macOS. — Clicking the notification opens that session. — The unread mark appears on the session and its project, and clears when the session is opened. — Nothing is sent when notifications are turned off. — Works in both the host and the sandboxed daemon runtime.
- **Kind**: feature
- **Issue**: #481
- **Worktree branch**: feat/notify-session-needs-attention
- **Started**: 2026-10-02
- **Phase**: 2-clarify
- **Next step**: Clarify round 2 (round 1 raised three questions, so it is not `CLEAN`): run `speckit-clarify` on the spec as it now stands; the round's commits stay local and ship in PR 2.

## Decisions

| # | Phase | Question | Answer | By | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | spec | Which spec number? | 039: 036 is taken by the flow in worktree `fix-issue-430` (not on `main`), 037 and 038 are on `main`, no open PR or worktree holds 039. | agent-resolved | `ls <worktree>/specs` across `git worktree list`; `gh pr list --state open`, 2026-10-02 |
| D2 | spec | The issue names Linux and macOS. Is Windows in scope? | Yes. Principle VI makes parity on all three a condition of done (FR-029). | agent-resolved | `.specify/memory/constitution.md` §VI; spec.md#Assumptions |
| D3 | spec | What is "the session currently focused"? | The selected session of a window with keyboard focus ("in view"). The same condition decides notification and unread. | agent-resolved | spec.md#Terms; issue acceptance criterion 1 ("or the window is unfocused") |
| D4 | spec | Do unread marks depend on the notification setting? | No. The switch stops desktop notifications only (FR-017, FR-027). | agent-resolved | spec.md#User Story 4 |
| D5 | spec | Is a session covered by Settings, or showing a regular terminal tab, in view? | Settings: not in view (the user cannot see it). Regular terminal tab: in view (its indicator is beside it). | agent-resolved | spec.md#Terms; Review Spec round 1 F1 |
| D6 | spec | Does a change missed during a lost connection count? | Yes, with a window open: it is treated as a change at reconnection (FR-006). At application start nothing is notified (FR-005); unread then waits on FR-008. | agent-resolved | spec.md FR-005, FR-006; Review Spec round 1 F2 |
| D7 | clarify | FR-008: a session changes to awaiting input while no window is open. What must happen? | (b) No desktop notification; the session is unread when the application is next opened. Unread state outlives the window and is stored on the user's computer (FR-008, FR-008a, FR-024). | user | Orchestrator relayed the user's answer, 2026-10-02; spec.md#Clarifications |
| D8 | clarify | FR-023: does the switcher's button show unread with its panel closed? | (a) Yes: the total of unread sessions in projects other than the active one, nothing when zero. | user | Orchestrator relayed the user's answer, 2026-10-02; spec.md#Clarifications |
| D9 | clarify | FR-028: a notification switch per AI CLI? | (a) No: one switch for every AI CLI; per-CLI is out of scope. | user | Orchestrator relayed the user's answer, 2026-10-02; spec.md#Clarifications |
| D10 | clarify | What is unread on the first start with the feature, or when the stored unread state cannot be read? | Nothing, and no error is shown: there is no record of what the user viewed (FR-008a). Same fallback as an unreadable settings file. | agent-resolved | spec.md#Edge Cases ("Settings file unreadable"); follows from D7 |
