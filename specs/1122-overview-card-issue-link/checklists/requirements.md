# Specification Quality Checklist: Overview cards, a link to the worktree's issue

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The two [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (FR-001, FR-010) were resolved in the clarify unit with
  the recommended defaults (spec.md#Clarifications), pending the owner's answer.
- `settings.json`, the `https` scheme and the issue addresses are named because they are the
  user-visible contract (the stored setting and the addresses the browser opens), as in features 533
  and 1102.
