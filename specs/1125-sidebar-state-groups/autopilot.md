| # | Phase | Question | Answer | By | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | spec | Overview button in the top bar: removed here? | No: it stays; #1127 removes it ("Blocked by: #1125 (Overview moves into the sidebar first)") | agent-resolved | issue #1127 body |
| D2 | spec | Order of Done vs Idle | Done last, after Idle | agent-resolved | issue #1125 body; mockup board sidebar |
| D3 | clarify 1 | Needs attention: own group or joins Needs action? | Joins Needs action; no separate group | agent-resolved | issue #1125 lists four groups; mockup puts fix/1117 "checks failing" (NeedsAttention, overview.rs card_state) under "Needs action · 2" |
| D4 | clarify 1 | Where do refresh, attach existing, run in parallel go? | A more (⋯) menu at the chip bar's end, beside add and hide | decided by user | jaro, 2026-10-24 |
| D5 | clarify 1 | Which groups are collapsible? | Every group; Done starts collapsed, the others expanded | decided by user | jaro, 2026-10-24 |
