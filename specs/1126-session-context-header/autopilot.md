## Decisions

- Clarify round 1 (strip tab contents, US2 sc. 3): option A, session tabs (main, then helpers) with the shown session's tab as its AI conversation, its shell tabs and "+" after it; New session runs **Start another session...** with its confirmation. Orchestrator's provisional pick of the recommended option, user decision pending (decision card). Applied to spec.md Terms, US2 sc. 3/7, FR-008 to FR-010, Key Entities (Tab), SC-004.
- Clarify round 2: session tab order and press behaviour agent-resolved from worktrees-and-sessions.md; no new requirement, clarify ends.
