## Declined review findings

| Milestone | Review | Finding | Why declined |
|---|---|---|---|

## Handover

None.

## Open escalation

None.

## Follow-ups not done

- Cloud session: `gh` unauthenticated, so `branch-start.sh` and `issue.sh` were skipped (orchestrator set labels/assignee via GitHub MCP; branch already at origin/main 828bc8e24). Not pushed: the orchestrator pushes with the design PR.
