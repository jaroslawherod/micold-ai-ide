# Autopilot ledger — #1724 orchestrator-registry-daemon-link

Kept by the `speckit-autopilot` skill. Records what this flow owns and how far it got. `resume`
finds this file by its **Worktree branch** line. Keep it true.

## Milestones

| ID | Tasks | Tier | Deliverable | PR | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | T001–T016 | full | orchestrator starts, links and lists a daemon, no session hosted | #… | pending |
| M2 | T017–T025 | full | heartbeat (LinkPing/LinkPong, protocol 81), offline and back online | #… | pending |
| M3 | T026–T030 | full | older-protocol daemon refused and listed needs-update | #… | pending |
| M4 | T031–T035 | full | one live link per id, reservation expiry | #… | pending |
| M5 | T036–T040 | full | registry persisted, restart lists all offline | #… | pending |
| M6 | T041–T043 | full | no-outbound proof (source test, netns), quickstart recorded | #… | pending |

M1 has 16 tasks (over ~10): Setup+Foundational+US1 cannot split without a milestone with no observable deliverable. Store moved to M5 so M1 stays in-memory. Next step: tasks analyze and review.

## Decisions

| # | Phase | Question | Answer | By | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | clarify | … | … | agent-resolved / user | <path#section, or "AskUserQuestion YYYY-MM-DD"> |

## Clarify

Round 1: 3 questions, all agent-resolved from the repo (local socket, JSON file atomically replaced, keepalive constants); no escalation, no new requirement.

## Review rounds

| Review | Round | Scope | Head | Snapshot | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec review | 1 | spec | aefdd44 | aefdd445998f481ca6d90346e166619373ec0f18:6f3f8c1eb35c332d2bcb12a8a26721384b0a327e | CHANGES: 3 MAJOR (fixed; F3 declined) |
| Spec review | 2 | spec fix diff | 26483b0 | 4a600a9093ae9f31e49c119977bea2be43dd4935:26483b071f6c280f063e568cd199eac4edfc4a45 | CLEAN (2 MINOR fixed, prose only) |
| Spec review | 2 | spec | a634d456f5dce2a86ef52452fb662a38ca838325 | 4a600a9093ae9f31e49c119977bea2be43dd4935:26483b071f6c280f063e568cd199eac4edfc4a45 | CLEAN |
| Plan review | 3 | plan fix diff | 083fc61c928b0d8ce21a594b04abb48d560e3fe4 | 7148d52d533661e32da2d27c68b70ccbca4522ed:b5c73c9b8026e32e151b9010fb4fe81a427e49d9 | CLEAN (rounds 1-2: 2 MAJOR each fixed; 2 MINOR fixed, prose only) |

## Declined review findings

| Milestone | Review | Finding | Why declined |
|---|---|---|---|
| spec | Spec review 1 | F3: three open markers block testability | Template allows three; clarify unit resolves them |
| tasks | analyze | F10 split T014/T010; F14 move T041 to M1; F16 dup note | Each task is one coherent file pair; the no-outbound proof needs the whole feature; T018/T021 mention is harmless |

## Handover

None. <or, when a unit handed over: what is done, the next step, open findings with their review
snapshots. The next unit sets it back to None.>

## Open escalation

None. <or, one question:>

```
- **Category**: <number and name from rules/escalation.md>
- **Question**: <one sentence>
- **Options**:
  1. <label> (Recommended) — <description>
  2. <label> — <description>
- **Recommended**: <label> — <reason>
- **Evidence**: <paths, commands, results>
- **Banner**: sent <date>
```

<A batch: `### Q1`, `### Q2`... each holding Question, Options, Recommended and Evidence; Category and
Banner stay above them. `scripts/autopilot/run-status.sh` reads these fields.>

## Follow-ups not done

<Defects found outside this flow's work, scope deliberately cut, etc. Copied into the handoff.>
