## Declined review findings

| Milestone | Review | Finding | Why declined |
|---|---|---|---|
| spec | spec review r1 | F1 MAJOR: three open markers (FR-008..010) leave scope unsettled | They are the template's allowed three; the rubric sends each to clarify. FR-008 is escalated there. Fixed F2, F3, F4 (prose/edge case). |

## Handover

None.

## Open escalation

None.

## Follow-ups not done

- docs/user-guide/sandboxed-daemon.md promises a sandbox pushes with a pasted token, but no client code delivers `[[github.tokens]]` to a container (deliver_container) either; separate follow-up.
