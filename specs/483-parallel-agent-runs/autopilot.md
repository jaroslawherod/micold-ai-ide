# Autopilot ledger — #483 parallel-agent-runs

Kept by the `speckit-autopilot` skill. Records what this flow owns and how far it got. `resume`
finds this file by its **Worktree branch** line. Keep it true.

- **Input**: Issue #483 "Run one prompt across several agents in parallel worktrees and pick the best result" (scope verbatim from the issue); labels: enhancement, flow:feature
- **Kind**: feature
- **Effort**: default
- **Issue**: #483
- **Worktree branch**: claude/project-thread-wysm57
- **Started**: 2026-10-08
- **Phase**: spec
- **Next step**: plan unit (the two clarify defaults await user confirmation; revisit if the user answers otherwise)

## Decisions

- Clarify US4 scenario 9: a picked run with uncommitted changes is refused, naming the files;
  nothing changes. _(default, pending user confirmation)_
- Clarify FR-012: a pick always merges (fast-forward when possible, else a merge commit); the run's
  branch is never rewritten. _(default, pending user confirmation)_
- Clarify round 2: no critical ambiguities left; clarify done.
