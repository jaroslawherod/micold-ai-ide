## Follow-ups not done

- Issue #687 duplicates this feature's scope; close it with the final PR.
- Spec 491's tree shows SSH as out of scope; no change needed.
- Plan R3: macOS/Windows clients need a bundled `linux-x86_64` daemon to reach Linux hosts (adds daemon size to those packages); tasks sequence it last and separable. Owner to confirm packaging size.
