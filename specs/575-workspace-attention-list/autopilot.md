# Autopilot ledger — #575 workspace-attention-list

Kept by the `speckit-autopilot` skill. Records what this flow owns and how far it got. `resume`
finds this file by its **Worktree branch** line. Keep it true.

- **Input**: Implement GitHub issue #575 "Show sessions that need attention at workspace level" (show unread sessions at workspace level: per-project marks with counts in the switcher, one workspace-wide list naming project, worktree and session, selecting an entry opens it like a notification click, live and restart-proof, reusing the existing attention state). labels: enhancement
- **Kind**: feature
- **Effort**: default
- **Issue**: #575
- **Worktree branch**: claude/project-thread-8dnq8h
- **Started**: 2026-10-05
- **Phase**: clarify
- **Next step**: clarify unit: resolve the [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec.md FR-001 (where the list opens) and FR-004 (entry order).
