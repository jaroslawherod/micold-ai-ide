## Decisions

- Clarify rounds: round 1 (FR-011 new read-only MCP tool; FR-015 Default refused outright); round 2 via speckit-clarify (attach session = idle entry; resume attaches its worktree first), all agent-resolved; round 3 (speckit-clarify): "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification" (deferred to plan: dismissing the start-up offer; a session already running outside Micold; "empty catalog" is per project).

| # | Phase | Question | Answer | By | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | plan | Dismissing the start-up offer | per project, per run, in memory; "Attach existing..." dialog stays | agent | research R5 |
| P2 | plan | Session already running outside Micold | not detected; documented | agent | research R7 |
| P3 | plan | 026 auto-adoption vs FR-012 | keep 026 adoption; deviation recorded | agent | plan Complexity Tracking |
